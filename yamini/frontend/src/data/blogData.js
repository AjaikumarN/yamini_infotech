## 10 Proven Ways to Reduce Your Office Printing Costs

Printing costs can silently eat into your office budget. At Yamini Infotech, we've helped hundreds of businesses in Tirunelveli optimize their printing expenses. Here are our top 10 tips:

### 1. Choose the Right Machine
The biggest cost factor is your machine itself. A Kyocera ECOSYS printer can save you ₹0.30–₹0.50 per page compared to older models.

### 2. Use Duplex (Double-Sided) Printing
Set duplex as default. This alone saves **50% on paper costs**.

### 3. Get a Comprehensive AMC
Regular maintenance prevents costly breakdowns. An [AMC from Yamini Infotech](/services?type=amc_support) includes toner, saving you 20-30% on supplies.

### 4. Use Draft Mode for Internal Documents
Switch to draft quality for internal memos and emails. Saves 30-40% toner.

### 5. Implement Print Policies
- Set black & white as default
- Require PIN to print (prevents waste)
- Monitor usage per department

### 6. Keep Your Machine Clean
Dirty machines waste toner and cause jams. Schedule quarterly cleaning.

### 7. Choose the Right Paper
Use 70 GSM paper for internal use. Save ₹200-₹300 per ream vs. premium paper.

### 8. Buy Toner in Bulk
Yamini Infotech offers bulk toner discounts. Buy 5+ at a time and save 15%.

### 9. Go Digital Where Possible
Scan documents instead of photocopying. Use email instead of printed memos.

### 10. Monitor and Track Usage
Ask Yamini Infotech to install print tracking software. See exactly where your money goes.

### How Much Can You Save?

| Current Practice | Optimized Practice | Monthly Savings |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Single-side printing | Duplex printing | ₹1,500 |
| No maintenance plan | AMC included toner | ₹2,000 |
| Premium paper always | 70 GSM for internal | ₹500 |
